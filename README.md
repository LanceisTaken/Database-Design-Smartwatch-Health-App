# Database-Design-Smartwatch-Health-App

A database design coursework done in collbaration with a coursement.

We were tasked to creating and designing a database for a smartwatch health application

Provided in this repository is our sql export for that database as we made it in phpmyadmin as well as made a php webpage to display some queries for navigating our database. You can view the ERD of the database within Documentation.

Please go through the documentation as that showcases our early ERD drafts, mindsets and snippets of all queries we used
